# ðŸš€ Creating a Web app For a Linear Regression Time Series Model ðŸ“ˆ ðŸš€


## OBJECTIVE
The aim of this project is to deploy a time series model.From training, my model of choice is the Linear Regression Model

## What you will find in this repository
- The source code can be found in the src folder
- The needed CSV files can be found in the dataset folder
- The Notebook folder contains the Notebook I used for my EDA and a comparison of the model 
- I used the Virtualevn Python environment
- The model can be found in the model folder

### Manual Setup

You can clone this repo

For manual installation, you need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system.Then you create a virtual environment and install requirements.txt file


- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

 Run the streamlit app (being at the repository root):
        
  - Sreamlit:
    
    - src

          streamlit run src\Home.py
